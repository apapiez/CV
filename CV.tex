\section{Personal Statement}

I began studying for my PhD in the physical chemistry of polymers in the summer of 2013. My post-graduate research experience has allowed me to grow as an independent researcher while co-operating closely with others to achieve research objectives. 

During my academic career, I have been required to present my research both internally (for examination and peer review) and externally (at conferences and to my industrial sponsor); I have become highly adept and presenting complex information in a clear and concise fashion in a manner appropriate for the audience at the time.
