\section{Profile}
My attention and eye for detail have allowed me to be successful in my research career. As a self sufficient individual I have shown initiative in solving problems which have arisen promptly. In early 2016 I was invited to the International Congress on Marine Corrosion and Fouling in Toulon, France; where I presented aspects of my work to attendees. During the course of my studies I have consistently developed my ability to communicate ideas in a clear and concise manner while maintaining a engaging connection with the audience. I believe this is key to building rapports and successful working relationships.

\section{Interests}
I am a capable programmer and enjoy the creative thinking involved in solving technical problems; in conjunction with DIY electronics, I enjoy building software and hardware to tackle real world problems.
\\

I am an avid reader - my favourite genre is historical non-fiction as I enjoy learning about the past and the lessons it holds for today's world. This spurs my interest in politics and current affairs, which I enjoy debating in great detail. \\

I love the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, my favourites being The Mikado and Iolanthe. I am fascinated by the intricate combination of language and musical theatre which they employ to make clever satirical comments.\\
